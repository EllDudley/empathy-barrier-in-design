There's a hidden inefficiency in many user experience/user interface best practices.

<h2> A Fantastic User Experience </h2> 

For instance, let's look at probably the best user experience in the world, a Google Search.

Google's designers are some of the best in the world. And as you can see, their simplicity is beautiful. Copious amounts of time have been spent to make this page the way it is today.

The thing that is missing is the lack of empathy with the user. While Google’s user experience is seamless and accurate, it doesn’t seem to account for the individual’s emotions, motives, and thoughts. It doesn’t reach that next level and that’s not their fault.

<h2> The Current Solution </h2>

So to compensate, they start measuring searches to try to understand user psychology.

The issue with this top down approach is it often produces errant conclusions, which are painstakingly obvious on the individual level.

<h2> A Radically Different Solution </h2>

By allowing designers to measure the emotions and dive into the thoughts of the users, designers would be able to satisfy their users’ needs and desires in an exponentially better and more complete way.

As time progresses, computers will be able to read your thoughts and emotions so the prudent thing to do would be to start hooking up some users (with adequate funding and supervision of course) to mind reading machines and start designing services for them using that data. Rather than only understanding the users’ emotions with relation to your site, you would be able to understand the users’ emotions and thoughts in the context of their lives. This would be a massive step forward in empathy, which would allow for the creation of technologies that satisfy users’ needs in an entirely new way. 

<h2> A Bit Of Philosophy and A Lot of Potential </h2>

Empathy is one of the biggest barriers we face in general society and especially for those designing technologies for people they will probably never meet. On a philosophical level, many of us don't help each other often not out of selfishness but more out of ignorance. If people could feel how their users were feeling, many designers would jump on the opportunity to make them feel better. 

Another important point is that it is the nature of designers to have to spend time alone to have the seperation of thought from other people to develop their own independent and unique experiences for their users. Because designers sometimes are introverted, they sometimes don't meet their users. This may allow for designers to completely understand their users without ever meeting them in real life. 

<h2> Next Steps </h2> 

The most prudent thing to do with current technology (it's not scalable) is to have your designers meet your users in person in a completely informal way and become friends with them. This will break the empathy barrier today while technology will break the empathy barrier in the future.
